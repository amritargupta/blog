While slowly sipping from hot cut of tea waiting to start my day thinking about how i woke up with the sunlight on my face. 

Feeling the cold breeze around myself, i took few minutes to get out of bed. The sweet smell of the flowers is coming from the window just like everyday. Its now a part of my every morning, walking around in the garden, smelling the sweet flowers, enjoying every second of the stroll. 

Suddenly i was jolted back with my mother's voice "Nisha, Are you listening .. Your phone is ringing ... ".

I ran to my room and picked the call and spoke "Hello" into the speaker. 
From the other side someone replied "Hey Nisha, Do you remember me .. I am Kabir .." 

I was stunned for some time, i was sure i was in some dream. The again from the other side of the phone came sound "Are you there .. ". 

I replied in a shivering voice replied "I am here .. ". Kabir asked "Do you remember me .. ". 

"I remember .. " said I. 

He said "i want to meet you .. ". 

Kabir and I were really good friends in college. But after college he landed a job and we never met or talked again. I also went for my higher studies and got busy with my job. 

"I am still here .. Nisha please speak something .. " Kabir said from other side of the phone. 
I was not sure what to say, I said "We will meet sometime .. ". But Kabir insisted on meeting today. He requested a lot to meet me today. In the end i gave up and said Ok we will meet and we decided to meet in evening.

In college time we were really good friends, and used to talk a lot. Our friends used to tease us saying there is something happening between you two, but Kabir never noticed these things. I used to always like him, but Kabir never talked about it and never showed any interest. Probably because of this i kept my feelings to myself.

Entire day i was thinking about "Why Kabir want to meet me. He has moved ahead in his life. I don't know whether he is married or not. Will he come alone or with his wife." These were the thoughts running through me. 

I was unable to concentrate on any tasks in office, unable to complete any work and was entirely occupied with these thoughts. I left from office early today. When i reached home mom asked Nisha you came early today. 

I said i am going out and would be coming late. I left from the house but got stuck in traffic jam. There were lot of questions running in my mind and as i was nearing the hotel i started getting more and more nervous. I reached quite late due to the heavy traffic jam.

After parking the car, i walked towards the hotel and saw Kabir standing in front of the hotel waiting for me. 

When i reached nearer he said "Hello Nisha .. How are you .. ". 
I said "I am good .. ". He said "You have not changed, Your face is glowing the same it used to when you were in college ..". I said "lets go inside ..". He said "So sorry, I totally forgot. Looking at you.". 

The manager met us in front of the hotel and let us inside the hotel. He took us inside and directed towards the grand hall. Kabir insisted that i should go inside first. I opened the door and was stunned. The whole area was filled with roses, walls were decorated with Red ballons. 

I was totally stunned, I asked Kabir "Whats this .. ". 

He led me inside and said "Nisha, I love you .. I have always liked you .. and i wish to marry you .. ". I was totally shocked, stunned and looking at Kabir's face. 

So many thoughts were going through my mind "Is this real", "I must be sleeping", "This is unbelivible", but my deep feelings for him bought a smile on my face. I have always liked him and waited for this proposal but during our college time it never came. He bought a big rose bouquet for me. 

He said again *"Nisha will you please marry me"*. I took the bouquet and said yes.

We have a lovely dinner and talked a lot, he told me later that today is Valentines' day when people tell there feelings to whom they like.

I had totally forgotten about this after Kabir's phone came in morning. This happened to be most memorable day of my life and i want to remember it every time.
