  <p>While slowly sipping from hot cut of tea waiting to start my day thinking about how i woke up with the sunlight on my face.</p>

<p>Feeling the cold breeze around myself, i took few minutes to get out of bed. The sweet smell of the flowers is coming from the window just like everyday. Its now a part of my every morning, walking around in the garden, smelling the sweet flowers, enjoying every second of the stroll.</p>

<p>Suddenly i was jolted back with my mother&rsquo;s voice &ldquo;Nisha, Are you listening .. Your phone is ringing &hellip; &ldquo;.</p>

<p>I ran to my room and picked the call and spoke &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; into the speaker.
From the other side someone replied &ldquo;Hey Nisha, Do you remember me .. I am Kabir ..&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was stunned for some time, i was sure i was in some dream. The again from the other side of the phone came sound &ldquo;Are you there .. &ldquo;.</p>

<p>I replied in a shivering voice replied &ldquo;I am here .. &ldquo;. Kabir asked &ldquo;Do you remember me .. &ldquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember .. &rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>He said &ldquo;i want to meet you .. &ldquo;.</p>

<p>Kabir and I were really good friends in college. But after college he landed a job and we never met or talked again. I also went for my higher studies and got busy with my job.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am still here .. Nisha please speak something .. &rdquo; Kabir said from other side of the phone.
I was not sure what to say, I said &ldquo;We will meet sometime .. &ldquo;. But Kabir insisted on meeting today. He requested a lot to meet me today. In the end i gave up and said Ok we will meet and we decided to meet in evening.</p>

<p>In college time we were really good friends, and used to talk a lot. Our friends used to tease us saying there is something happening between you two, but Kabir never noticed these things. I used to always like him, but Kabir never talked about it and never showed any interest. Probably because of this i kept my feelings to myself.</p>

<p>Entire day i was thinking about &ldquo;Why Kabir want to meet me. He has moved ahead in his life. I don&rsquo;t know whether he is married or not. Will he come alone or with his wife.&rdquo; These were the thoughts running through me.</p>

<p>I was unable to concentrate on any tasks in office, unable to complete any work and was entirely occupied with these thoughts. I left from office early today. When i reached home mom asked Nisha you came early today.</p>

<p>I said i am going out and would be coming late. I left from the house but got stuck in traffic jam. There were lot of questions running in my mind and as i was nearing the hotel i started getting more and more nervous. I reached quite late due to the heavy traffic jam.</p>

<p>After parking the car, i walked towards the hotel and saw Kabir standing in front of the hotel waiting for me.</p>

<p>When i reached nearer he said &ldquo;Hello Nisha .. How are you .. &ldquo;.
I said &ldquo;I am good .. &ldquo;. He said &ldquo;You have not changed, Your face is glowing the same it used to when you were in college ..&rdquo;. I said &ldquo;lets go inside ..&rdquo;. He said &ldquo;So sorry, I totally forgot. Looking at you.&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The manager met us in front of the hotel and let us inside the hotel. He took us inside and directed towards the grand hall. Kabir insisted that i should go inside first. I opened the door and was stunned. The whole area was filled with roses, walls were decorated with Red ballons.</p>

<p>I was totally stunned, I asked Kabir &ldquo;Whats this .. &ldquo;.</p>

<p>He led me inside and said &ldquo;Nisha, I love you .. I have always liked you .. and i wish to marry you .. &ldquo;. I was totally shocked, stunned and looking at Kabir&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>So many thoughts were going through my mind &ldquo;Is this real&rdquo;, &ldquo;I must be sleeping&rdquo;, &ldquo;This is unbelivible&rdquo;, but my deep feelings for him bought a smile on my face. I have always liked him and waited for this proposal but during our college time it never came. He bought a big rose bouquet for me.</p>

<p>He said again <em>&ldquo;Nisha will you please marry me&rdquo;</em>. I took the bouquet and said yes.</p>

<p>We have a lovely dinner and talked a lot, he told me later that today is Valentines&rsquo; day when people tell there feelings to whom they like.</p>

<p>I had totally forgotten about this after Kabir&rsquo;s phone came in morning. This happened to be most memorable day of my life and i want to remember it every time.</p>
